    "This work deals with an application of the Logistic Regression (LR) algorithm to some Loan Data database, in order to obtain a model that allows to classify them as possible Loan receivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three models are tried: 1) Classical LR.  2) LR using OPTIMAL-RFECV variables selection. 3) LR using PCA variables reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two datasets are considering: 1) Reduced dataset without missing values.  2) A full dataset with missing values filled.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original datasets can be downloaded from [here](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-loan-prediction-iii/). Anyway, in the present project, I have combined both datasets (\"train\" and \"test\") into one named it \"LoanFull.csv\". Here is the description of variables:\n",

    "<u>Dependent variable (predicted variable)</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "* <b>Loan_Status</b>: Loan approved (Y/N)\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Independent variables (predictors)</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "* <b>Gender</b>: Male/ Female\n",
    "* <b>Married</b>: Applicant married (Y/N)\n",
    "* <b>Dependents</b>: Number of dependents\n",
    "* <b>Education</b>: Applicant Education (Graduate/ Under Graduate)\n",
    "* <b>Self_Employed</b>: Self employed (Y/N)\n",
    "* <b>ApplicantIncome</b>: Applicant income\n",
    "* <b>CoapplicantIncome</b>: Coapplicant income\n",
    "* <b>LoanAmount</b>: Loan amount in thousands\n",
    "* <b>Loan_Amount_Term</b>: Term of loan in months\n",
    "* <b>Credit_History</b>: Credit history meets guidelines\n",
    "* <b>Property_Area</b>: Urban/ Semi Urban/ Rural\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Rol or ID variables</u>\n",
    "* <b>Loan_ID</b>: Unique Loan ID.\n",
