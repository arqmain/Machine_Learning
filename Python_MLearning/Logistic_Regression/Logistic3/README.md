# Python-MLearning: Loan Data using Logistic Regression (LR) and Sklearn

<br>

This work deals with an application of the Logistic Regression (LR) algorithm to some Loan Data database, in order to obtain a model that allows to classify them as possible Loan receivers.

The original datasets can be downloaded from here. Anyway, in the present project, I have combined both datasets ("train" and "test") into one named it "LoanFull.csv".
