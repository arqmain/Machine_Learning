# Python-MLearning: Portuguese Banking Data using Logistic Regression (LR) and PCA Reduced Dimension

<br>


This work deals with an application of the Logistic Regression (LR) algorithm to some clientâ€™s banking database, in order to obtain a model that allows to classify them as possible subscribers to a term deposit of some Portuguese bank.

The model obtained consider the PCA components of the database that explain 95% of the total variation of the data.
