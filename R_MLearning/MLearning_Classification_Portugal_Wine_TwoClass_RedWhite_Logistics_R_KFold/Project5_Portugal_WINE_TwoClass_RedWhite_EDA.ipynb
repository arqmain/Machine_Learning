    "\n",
    "This project develops Logistic Regression algorithm of machine learning to classify the class -\"white\" or \"red\"- of some wine. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the famous Portugal wine dataset.  Two datasets are available of which one dataset is about red wine and have 1599 different varieties and the other is on white wine and have 4898 varieties. I have combined them into one dataset named \"wine\" and created one additional variable \"Class\" with its categories \"white\" and \"red\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The original data along with detailed description can be found here [ http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality].\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns of the \"wine\" dataset are the variables (features): fixed acidity; volatile acidity; citric acid; residual sugar; chlorides; free sulfur dioxide; total sulfur dioxide; density; pH; sulphates; alcohol; quality. The 13th column is the Class of wine observed: white; red.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model was developed selecting the variables included by using the stepwise backward elimination method based on AIC and BIC selection criterion. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our original dataset is an imbalance one. There are 6497 registers but only 1599 (24.6%) are of the red class of wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model performance was evaluated using R, K fold cross-validation, and the ROC metric. I considered 70% and 30% original dataset splitting for the training and testing datasets respectively."
